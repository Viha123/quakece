# Chess Engine!
This is an attempt to make a Chess Engine that is UCI complient eventually, as well as a basic GUI that allows you to test and play the game. 
## Goals for Version 1:
- [ ] Make a basic gui that represents all the pieces in SFML
- [ ] basic class structure for internal and external representation of board
- [ ] make sure all moves are implemented correctly
- [ ] Test if all moves are implemented correctly using the test cases given in the wiki. 

## Goals for Version 2:
- [ ] implement more complex algorithms, not entirely sure, basic minimax or alpha beta pruning and move on from there.
