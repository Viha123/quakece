## Thoughts on decision making
- Currently i plan to use the 8 by 8 board representation to make it extremely simple for me to think, later it can be moved to more efficient bitboard implementations. 
- move generation will be done using the mailbox method (because that seems simplest):  
- represent this as a 1 d array instead of 2d array
